# Design Principles
At Menmo we do our ultimate best to craft a world-class API developers will love. 


## REST 
We are REST pragmatists: The ultimate goal is to maximize developer productivity, not to follow the REST specification.  

**Done is better than perfect.**

## Versioning
We put version at the top of the URI. 

/v1/.. 
/v2/..
..and so on

## Formats
Currently only JSON is supported as return format. 

We may add XML or others in the future, using ".xml" and ".json" extensions. 

## Pagination
We use 'index' and 'limit' parameters.
