## Apply for an API key
In order to use the API you need an API key, here are a few things to bear in mind before you get started:

* Attribution: You must display "Provided by Everysport.com" wherever Everysport data is used.
* Linking: You must link to Everysport teams and events wherever you display such data.
* Exclusivity: You must not combine Everysport data with similar data from other sources. 
* You may only make calls to the Everysport API at a reasonable rate. 
* You may not store Everysport data for any other purpose than caching for a short period of time. 
* For Non-commercial: You must tell us if you start using the data for Commercial use, we reserve rights to revoke access if this is not complied with.
* For Commercial: We have the right to revoke access if your use of the data competes with products or services offered by Everysport. For example, Everysport.com is today one of the largest providers of sport data to media in Sweden, and a large online sport community.

The full Terms of Use are [here](/basics/terms_of_use.md).
